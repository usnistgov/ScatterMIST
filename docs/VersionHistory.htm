<h2>15. Version History</h2>

<h2>Version 1.00</h2>

<p>Version 1.00, the original version of MIST, was released in June 2004.</p>

<h2>Version 2.00</h2>

<p>Version 2.00 was released in July 2005 and represented a major upgrade. The program was changed to include a graphical user interface and was linked with <a href=
"https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 5.00.
  
<h2>Version 2.10</h2>
  
<p>Version 2.10 was released in August 2005 and represents a minor bug fix to MIST and <a href=
"https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a>. The rotation of the polarization sensitivity over a finite solid angle was miscalculated in previous versions. This version was linked with <a href=
"https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 5.01.
  
<h2>Version 2.20</h2>

<p>Version 2.20 was released in July 2006 and represents a minor bug fix to MIST and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a>. Prefix negative signs in some expressions were not handled correctly. This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 5.02.

<h2>Version 2.30</h2>

<p>Version 2.30 was released in August 2006 and represents a minor bug fix to MIST and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a>. The BRDF sampling file capability was restored, and file writing was significantly sped up. This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 5.03.
  
<h2>Version 3.00</h2>

<p>Version 3.00 was released in December 2007 and includes minor changes to MIST and compilation with a new version of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a>. This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 6.00. The main change to the MIST code is that it now includes the ability to rename the outputs.
  
<h2>Version 3.01</h2>

<p>Version 3.01 is a service update, incorporating a minor <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> change. This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 6.01.
  
<h2>Version 4.00</h2>

<p>Version 4.00 added the ability for each integral to have its own incident polarization.
  
<p>Alternative methods for integration were added, and the default was changed to integrate more uniformly over solid angle.
  
<p>The ANNULUS integral was added.

<p>Copy and paste capabilities were improved. Entire sections can be copy and pasted. When the model is changed, the user has the option to maintain the assigned values of identically-named parameters.
  
<p>The polarization sensitivity parameter of the integrals was changed from a dropdown list to a simple string variable.
  
<p>This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 7.00.
    
<h2>Version 4.01</h2>

<p>This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 7.01.

<h2>Version 4.10</h2>

<p>This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 7.10.

<h2>Version 4.20</h2>

<p>This version was linked with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/SCATMECH/docs/index.htm">SCATMECH</a> version 7.20.

<h2>Version 4.21</h2>
